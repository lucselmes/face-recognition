# face-recognition

A python program that performs face recognition and allows users to store identities of specific users. A caching mechanism is implemented to store information about recently seen faces. If the solution identifies a previously unseen face the user is prompted to attach an "identity" to this face, i.e., a name.

## Further use
This can be used as a basis for developing solutions that leverage facial recognition, e.g., creating a camera doorbell that sends you a text when a given friend is at the front door. A caching mechanism is used to store recently observed faces to give the developer the ability to only perform specific actions a set number of times within a specified time frame.
